Virtual Internship - Android Application Development Using Kotlin

## The Grocery Basket

This Project is part of Virtual Internship In Android using Kotlin by SmartInternz which was 8 weeks of Virtual Internship Program Supported by Google Developers and approved by AICTE. Where I learned how to build android apps using Kotlin

Name of App :  The Grocery Basket

Objective : 
As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything

Project Description :
This app consisted of an Interface where the user can note down the list of items he wants to buy with item quantity and its price. This app will also show the total cost of the items user will buy.And if the user doesn't want a particular item to buy he can also delete that from the list of items.
